The console game "Rock_Paper_Scissors"
Last Update: 24.09.2022 - I upgraded the game. Now, the user can reply it as much as they want. While they do that, the game keeps a record of the number of won, lost and drawn game. When the user finally
decides to end the game, the program prints the Final Score board.
